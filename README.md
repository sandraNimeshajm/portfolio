# About me

Hi, I'm Sandra. I began my career as a web developer, learning coding and web technologies. I later found that Quality Assurance (QA) was a better fit for me because I enjoy paying attention to details and solving problems effectively. I transitioned to a QA role to leverage these skills and ensure top-notch product quality. Since the start of 2023, I've dedicated myself to the pursuit of becoming a Quality Assurance professional. It's been a fulfilling journey, and I'm delighted to have found a niche where I can continually evolve. My aspiration is to excel in ensuring the excellence of products and services. I envision the QA role as a platform to contribute, at the very least, in making the digital sphere more inclusive for everyone. Within this portfolio, I aim to share my comprehensive understanding of QA alongside exhibiting the practical skills acquired through both formal courses and self-study. I am resolute in my commitment to advancing in this field. Lately, I've ventured into learning test automation, placing my primary focus on expanding and refining my expertise in this domain.
